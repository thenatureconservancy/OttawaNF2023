    "text": "Summary\nIn general the Ottawa National Forest, as of 2020, had not experienced substantial conversion of natural ecosystems to developed or agricultural types, though there are some patterns to note:\n\nIt is tempting to directly compare the past and present maps-do so with caution as the classification system has been modified.\nThe Laurentian-Acadian Northern Hardwoods Forest type is still dominant regardless of classification system.\nThe aspen-birch EVT that was mapped in 2020 may have been a succession class in the historical ecosystems. It is not clear from this analysis alone if this type has changed in extent, or not.\nNote-there are some changes in the wetland naming convention. For example the Boreal-Laurentian Conifer Acidic Swamp and Treed Poor Fen is not represented in the BpS classification."
